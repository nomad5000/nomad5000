# Michael Schmidt (**Backend** programmer)

Since 2011 I'm a professional programmer. And I have seen all faces of the job. That’s why I specialised in Backend, because I just know I like it best.

I’m all about developing API’s and connecting to third party ones. My favorite tool for that is python. But I can manage with others like php or any **OPEN SOURCE** stack.

Integrations like payment providers (Stripe), Google calendars and bookkeeping software (Sevdesk) are super interesting to me and I enjoy the challenge of figuring out how they work with or without documentation.

Databases are something I just naturally always have been good at since I first got to know them in university and also now, with new features like spatial queries.

I know a lot about servers even though I’m no sysadmin and don’t want to be one. I manage perfectly fine to work with a stack running on Heroku or setting up a linux environment on digitalocean or AWS. Let’s just say I know the unix world.

I learned the hard way that quality in programs is when others can read and change your code without breaking the entire system. As I understood that, I put a lot of effort into developing testing skills. So I can say I always write tests (integration and unit) **WHENEVER IT MAKES SENCE**.

My clients like working with me because I give them good advice, I have the result in mind and not the technology. It’s always more important to me that I deliver an optimal solution rather than something super fancy but way to costly.

I speak German Spanish and English and I can do a lot on the project management part, but I’m not a project manager for large scale teams.

I enjoy working in teams that are small and have a **good mistake culture**. When everybody knows his or her strengths and has some backup for his or her weeknesses the results can be amazing, even with 5 people.
